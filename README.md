## My process

### Built with

- Sass
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a fun little project that gave me a bit of a challenge, in particular with the hero image. Not sure how I could‚Äôve achieved this any other way, but I could see myself revisiting this project at a later stage. It was a great opportunity to sharpen my grid skills. I could‚Äôve reduced the number of variables, but I just can‚Äôt let go of trying to future proof my work.

This was a fun little project that I really enjoyed building it and it is one that I will look at in fondness at my skill level these days!
